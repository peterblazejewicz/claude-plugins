# .NET Agent Skills

Adapted from [addyosmani/agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills) (MIT © 2025 Addy Osmani) with .NET/C# framing. See the plugin [`README.md`](../README.md) and [`NOTICE.md`](../NOTICE.md) for attribution details.

## What This Command Does

Lists the skills currently available in this plugin and the natural-language prompts that trigger them. Skills activate automatically when your request matches their description — you rarely invoke them by hand.

## Related commands

8 short command wrappers ship alongside this catalog — 7 lifecycle wrappers ported from the upstream `.claude/commands/` set with .NET framing, plus the `/webperf` specialist audit. See the plugin [`README.md`](../README.md#commands) for the full mapping.

| What you're doing          | Command           | Key principle                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Define what to build       | `/spec`           | Spec before code                               |
| Plan how to build it       | `/plan`           | Small, atomic tasks with `dotnet` verification |
| Build incrementally        | `/build`          | One slice at a time, or `/build auto` for the whole plan |
| Prove it works             | `/test`           | xUnit/MSTest as proof                          |
| Review before merge        | `/review`         | Five-axis review, `file.cs:line` findings      |
| Simplify the code          | `/code-simplify`  | Clarity over cleverness                        |
| Ship to production         | `/ship`           | Parallel fan-out → merge → rollback plan       |
| Audit web performance      | `/webperf`        | Honest CWV audit (Blazor / ASP.NET Core web only) |

If `/test` or `/review` is shadowed by another command in your setup, use the qualified form: `/dotnet-skills:test`, `/dotnet-skills:review`.

## Agents

4 .NET-adapted subagents ship alongside the commands and skills — reusable personas for deeper single-purpose work, ported from the upstream `agents/` set. Launch them with the `Agent` tool and `subagent_type: dotnet-skills:<name>` (they're not slash commands). Claude Code auto-namespaces plugin-provided subagents, so they coexist with built-in and sibling-plugin agents of the same short name.

`/ship` is the canonical parallel-fan-out entry point — it spawns all three personas concurrently, then the main agent synthesizes their reports against the .NET pre-launch checklist into a go/no-go decision with a `dotnet ef database update <PreviousMigration>` rollback plan. For the full composition model (the user or a slash command is always the orchestrator; personas never call each other), see [`references/agents-overview.md`](../references/agents-overview.md) for the decision matrix and [`references/orchestration-patterns.md`](../references/orchestration-patterns.md) for the pattern catalog, Claude Code subagent/Agent-Teams interop, and a `TaskCanceledException` competing-hypothesis worked example.

- **code-reviewer** — Staff-engineer persona conducting a five-axis code review (correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance) with .NET-specific checks: nullable-reference-type honesty, `CancellationToken` threading, DI lifetime correctness, EF Core N+1 / `FromSqlRaw` flagging, `IHttpClientFactory` vs per-call `HttpClient`, Avalonia/Blazor UI-thread marshalling. Emits `file.cs:line`-anchored findings categorized Critical / Important / Suggestion. Triggers: *"review this PR as a Staff Engineer"*, *"give me a thorough five-axis review"*.
- **security-auditor** — Security-engineer persona running an OWASP-aligned audit of the ASP.NET Core / Blazor / MAUI stack: FluentValidation + `FromSqlInterpolated` for input; Identity + JWT bearer + policy-based authz for authN/authZ; Data Protection + Key Vault + PII scrubs for data protection; security-header middleware + CORS + `dotnet list package --vulnerable` for infrastructure; HMAC webhook verification + OAuth PKCE for third-party. Emits Critical / High / Medium / Low findings with proof-of-concept and a .NET-API-grounded fix. Triggers: *"security audit this service"*, *"check this endpoint for OWASP Top 10"*.
- **test-engineer** — QA-engineer persona designing test suites, writing tests, and analyzing coverage gaps: xUnit v3 (or v2) or MSTest with native `Assert.X`, `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` for HTTP, Testcontainers for DB (not `EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory`), `Microsoft.Playwright` for Blazor/Razor, `Avalonia.Headless.XUnit` for Avalonia; `TimeProvider` + `FakeTimeProvider` for time-dependent tests; Prove-It Pattern for bug fixes. Triggers: *"plan the test suite for this feature"*, *"write a failing test for this bug"*, *"analyze test coverage gaps"*.
- **web-performance-auditor** — Web-performance-engineer persona auditing Blazor (Server / WebAssembly / Auto `@rendermode`) and ASP.NET Core MVC / Razor Pages front ends against Core Web Vitals: render-mode choice, WASM payload (trimming / AOT / globalization / lazy-load), `MapStaticAssets` fingerprint + brotli, prerender + `PersistentComponentState`, `<Virtualize>` / `ShouldRender` / `StateHasChanged`, `AddOutputCache`. Never fabricates metrics — source-only audits are labeled `potential impact`. Invoked via `/webperf` (**not** part of the `/ship` fan-out — web front ends only); server-runtime concerns hand off to `performance-optimization-dotnet`. Triggers: *"audit Core Web Vitals on this Blazor page"*, *"why is this Razor page slow to load?"*.

## Meta

- **using-agent-skills** — Discovers and invokes the right skill from this plugin for the task at hand; governs how every other skill activates. Triggers: *"which skill should I use for X?"*, *"start a new .NET session"*, *"give me a phase-by-phase map"*.

## Skills available now

**Define** — figure out what to build:

- **test-driven-development** — RED/GREEN/REFACTOR with xUnit v3 (or v2) or MSTest using native `Assert.X`, the Prove-It Pattern for bug fixes, `TimeProvider`/`FakeTimeProvider` for deterministic time. Triggers: *"let's write the test first"*, *"how do I test this?"*.
- **integration-testing-dotnet** — Tests the four .NET integration boundaries: HTTP (`WebApplicationFactory<T>`), DB (Testcontainers with real providers), browser (`Microsoft.Playwright`), Avalonia desktop (`Avalonia.Headless.XUnit`). Triggers: *"test this endpoint end-to-end"*, *"verify the EF Core query against Postgres"*, *"write a Playwright test for this Blazor page"*.

**Review** — hold the bar:
- **code-review-and-quality** — Five-axis review (correctness, readability, architecture, security, performance) with .NET checks (async correctness, DI lifetimes, EF Core N+1). Triggers: *"review this PR"*, *"is this ready to merge?"*.
